# Assignment 5: JSON Memorize Theme

https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/assignment_5.pdf

## Required Task #1
Remove the “random number of  cards” theme option from your Memorize game.  
Each theme will now have its own specific, pre-defined number of  cards.  
In other words, how many cards are in a game is part of  the theme for that game and it can no longer be “random”. 

### Solution



## Required Task #2
Every time a new game starts, print a JSON representation of the theme being used for that game out to the console. 
All elements of the theme (its name, the emojis to choose from, how many pairs of  cards to show and the color of  the theme) must be included. 


### Solution
